## Steps

* design a solution (in english what do you need to do)
* break down the problem into smaller chunks
* start working on chunks
  * define an outcome (how do you know when the chunk is complete)
  * define a validation (write a test)
  * write code
  * validate code (test passes)
  * commit
  * read code and refactor
  * commit
  * repeat for next chunk


### SOLUTION

1. Create an index.html to serve when user hits localhost:7890/index.html

#### Broken Down

1. write a test
1. serve html file
1. pass test
1. refactor
1. pass test
